# MIREN-shiny
This is a draft for an app designed for the data collection process of the MIREN project. This is a project involving many researchers across the world, and the data reporting process was not optimized. In particular, researchers would send their observations on excel sheets, resulting in many compilation problems. When building this, I focused on the two aspects that the people working on this project explained were the main source of problems: name-checking with WorldFlora and coordinate checks. I built a basic prototype of an online form for this project in [shiny.bernatbramon.com](https://shiny.bernatbramon.com) (_this app was discontinued_). Despite its simplicity, however, the framework that I used has the advantage that is very flexible and easily scalable.

The form is built using two amazon servers, an EC2 and an RDS server. The EC2 server hosts a shiny app, while the RDS server hosts a MySQL database. The advantage of using these servers is that one can increase the power/capacity/size of the servers without changing anything else (literally in two clicks).
